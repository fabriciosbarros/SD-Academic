First Academic Project which evaluated logical thinking more than advanced coding.

REQUIREMENTS:

* Write a program to simulate a race.
* Program must take 4 player names
* Each player picks a number between 1 and 10
* Program uses this number and a random number(up to the value of the players choice) to calculate the amount of steps the player gets
* Player move is determined by calculating a value (how this value is calculated is up to you, must use the above two numbers) and is displayed on screen by indicators preceding player name. 
* The winner's name and number of steps is displayed.
* A race leader board is displayed.

eg.
................toby 
......dave 
............mick 
.....................Batman

Winner Batman with 35 steps 
Runner up toby with 30 steps

LEADERBOARD:
1st Batman 35 steps
2nd toby 
3rd mick 
4th dave

2nd ROUND

* Top two players race against each other
* Output winner and runner up : names and steps.

30 steps 
25 steps 
10 steps
